Goals:
Review open source Baxter code from Github and try to run

I got the joystick controller program working to the same level of functionality as the keyboard counterpart. I suspect something strange is still happening with the coordinate frame, but we decided to come back to the program at a later date to polish it off while I play around with more Baxter features.

I finished point_trajectory_input.py, which is a program that outputs instructions to the user using Baxter's head screen and gets as input from the user two desired joint configurations (by receiving button presses on its wrist cuff button). It then calculates a trajectory between the desired configurations and executes it 1000 times or until the user presses Ctrl-C.

After running the first version of the program, the hand jerked very suddenly whenever it gets to the desired position, which was not desirable. It probably has to do with requesting that the end effector come to a complete stop at the desired position. I slowed down the movement of the hand by doubling the requested time for the trajectory, but now it moves at an incredibly slow speed. Some more sophisticated trajectory generation would be worth looking into, but I suspect this is something that I could complete when I start delving more deeply into getting a working demo.

It might also be worthwhile to think about obstacle avoidance, and getting as input the end effector position, then figuring out a trajectory that's constrained by the end effector and not the 7 desired joint angles.
