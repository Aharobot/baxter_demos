Whoops, I forgot to log most of last week. That's okay, because I still achieved my goals, and a lot of my documentation has moved to a Google Spreadsheet.

Last week was the week of vision and this week is the week of grasping. However, the two are closely interrelated and I suspect I will spend quite a bit of time working on better vision for grasping. The end goal of this week is for Baxter to reliably servo near a block, pick it up and move without dropping it, with a stretch goal of doing the same for a round or irregularly shaped object.

Grasp Tasks, roughly in order of priority:

2D Alignment, assuming rectangular: find edges and align gripper to be parallel
Use cv2.cornerHarris to detect corners
Look around the area near the block centroid to find corners belonging to the block
Connect these corners (what if there's more than 4?)
OR use edge detection and HoughLines

Stereovision with grasping hand + off-hand and/or head camera: goal is to get a grasp pose and a trajectory

Check to see if IR rangefinder is calibrated (measuring tape) and figure out why using depth to estimate pose was not accurate

Kinect for stereo (similar idea to item 2, but without doing stereo myself)

Search algorithms for trajectory generation (collision avoidance--almost certainly need Kinect)

Work on a polished input program that gets an end pose from the user
