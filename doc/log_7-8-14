Today I got the end effector controller script working (ee_position_keyboard.py). However, the hand does not seem to move exactly in the coordinate frame we want it to move in.

To that end, it would be useful to simulate Baxter in Gazebo to see if my code is flawed or if Baxter's sensors are off. However, I don't have access to the baxter_simulator repo that will allow me to get Baxter working in GGazebo, so unfortunately we'll have to wait.

Meanwhile I am going to brainstorm ideas for more demos and start implementing the other demo idea from yesterday.
